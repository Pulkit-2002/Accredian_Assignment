# Questions
1. Data cleaning including missing values, outliers and multi-collinearity.

2. Describe your fraud detection model in elaboration.
Ans2. We have seen that Accuracy of both Random Forest and Decision Tree is equal, although teh precision of Random Forest is more. In a fraud detection model, Precision is highly important because rather than predicting normal transactions correctly we want Fraud transactions to be predicted correctly and Legit to be left off.If either of the 2 reasons are not fulfiiled we may catch the innocent and leave the culprit.
      This is also one of the reason why Random Forest and Decision Tree are used unstead of other algorithms.
      Also the reason I have chosen this model is because of highly unbalanced dataset (Legit: Fraud :: 99.87:0.13). 
      Random forest makes multiple decision trees which makes it easier (although time taking) for model to understand the data in a simpler way since Decision Tree makes decisions in a boolean way.
      Models like XGBoost, Bagging, ANN, and Logistic Regression may give good accuracy but they wont give good precision and recall values.

3. How did you select variables to be included in the model?
Ans3. Variable selection is crucial for developing an effective fraud detection model. The following steps were used to select the variables:
      Domain Knowledge: Understanding the financial transactions and potential indicators of fraud. 
                        Variables that are commonly associated with fraudulent behavior, such as unusual transaction amounts, frequency of transactions, and transaction locations, were prioritized.
      Correlation Analysis: Pearson correlation coefficient was used to identify highly correlated variables. 
                            Variables with high correlation (both positive and negative) to the target variable (fraudulent transactions) were considered.
      Feature Importance from Models: Using models like Random Forest, feature importance scores were generated. 
                                      These scores indicate the contribution of each feature to the prediction model. Features with higher importance scores were selected.
      Variance Inflation Factor (VIF): To address multi-collinearity, VIF was calculated for all features. 
                                       Features with a VIF above a threshold (e.g., 10) were considered to be highly collinear and were removed.
      Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): This technique was used to select the most relevant features by recursively fitting the model and removing the least important feature(s) at each step.

4. Demonstrate the performance of the model by using best set of tools.
Ans4. The performance of the model was evaluated using various metrics and techniques to ensure its effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions.
      Data Split: The dataset was split into training and validation sets (e.g., 80% training and 20% validation) to evaluate model performance.
      
      Model Selection and Training: 
      Random Forest and Decision Tree were selected due to their ability to handle unbalanced datasets and provide high precision, which is critical in fraud detection.
      Hyperparameter Tuning: Techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search were used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the models.
      
      Model Evaluation Metrics:
      Precision and Recall: Precision is crucial in fraud detection as it measures the number of true positive results divided by the number of true positive and false positive results. Recall (sensitivity) is also important as it measures the number of true positive results divided by the number of true positives and false negatives.
      F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
      ROC-AUC Score: Measures the models ability to distinguish between classes, providing a single metric to compare model performance.
      
      Model Interpretation:
      Confusion Matrix: To visualize the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
      Feature Importance Plot: To understand which features contributed the most to the model's predictions.
      SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) Values: To interpret individual predictions and understand the impact of each feature on the models output.

      Validation and Testing:
      The final model was tested on the validation set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
      Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC) on the validation set were reported to demonstrate the models effectiveness.
      
5. What are the key factors that predict fraudulent customer?
Ans5. The source of request is secured or not ?
      Is the name of organisation asking for money is legit or not ?
      Transaction history of vendors.

6. Do these factors make sense? If yes, How? If not, How not?
Ans6. Source of Request Secured or Not
      Makes Sense: Secure sources are less likely to be associated with fraud. Unsecured sources can indicate potential phishing or unauthorized access.
      
      Legitimacy of the Organization Asking for Money
      Makes Sense: Verifying the legitimacy of organizations helps identify fraudulent requests, as fraudsters often use fake names.
      
      Transaction History of Vendors
      Makes Sense: Consistent and legitimate transaction histories indicate trustworthy vendors. Unusual patterns can be red flags for fraud.
      
      In summary, these factors are logical and relevant for predicting fraudulent transactions.
      
7. What kind of prevention should be adopted while company update its infrastructure?
Ans7. Use smart vertified apps only.
      Browse through secured websites.
      Use secured internet connections (USE VPN).
      Keep your mobile and laptop security updated.
      Dont respond to unsolicited calls/SMS(s/E-mails) If you feel like you have been tricked or security compromised, contact your bank immidiately.
      
8. Assuming these actions have been implemented, how would you determine if they work?
Ans8. Bank sending E-statements.
      Customers keeping a check of their account activity.
      Always keep a log of your payments.
